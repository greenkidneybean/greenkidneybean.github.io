# Logistical Information
------
## Hotel
For those of you who do not have a reservation (I have made them for journal editors), the campus hotel is the [Glover Park Hotel](https://www.gloverparkhotel.com/). There is a special campus rate of $179 per night for the nights of March 17 and 18. Mention the code “Frontiers Meeting Group” when booking to get the rate. Please make any reservations before the end of the month to guarantee a room at that rate.

## Parking
Parking on the American University campus is enforced until 5pm on Friday at the rate of $2 per hour and then not enforced over the weekend. That will likely be the cheapest parking option. Parking at the hotel is $10 per day and $25 per 24 hours for overnight guests from the group rate.
