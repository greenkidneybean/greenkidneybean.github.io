# Expanding Donuts Animation

This page demonstrates an interactive animation of expanding donut circles.

## How it works

This animation creates expanding donut-like circles that pulse in a sine wave pattern. You can interact with the animation by scrolling your mouse wheel, which will temporarily speed up the expansion rate.
