About
======
I'm fascinated by microbes and the selective pressures that shape their evolution. I work at the National Human Genome Research Institute in Meru Sadhu's [Systems Biology & Genone Engineering Section](https://www.genome.gov/staff/Meru-J-Sadhu-PhD) and am currently focused on an evolutionary arms race between humans and poxviruses, please ask me about it some time!
